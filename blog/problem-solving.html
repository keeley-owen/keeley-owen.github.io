        This blog will be a surefire way to understand problem solving, and how
        I have fared in various examples.

        This example covers when I was faced with an insurmountable challenge,
        something that would be akin to a trial of Heracles, I was to write a
        blog post about problems and problem solving. I stared at the screen for
        minutes that felt like hours. A simple task, yet I felt the burden of
        extreme memory fog on my shoulders like a pack full of concrete...

        <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        I did some mental pseudocode, and thought each step out logically and in
        plain english, there were many times I had been stumped by a simple
        problem (it happens daily, and frequently at that) so I used my massive
        bonce to think of what I was currently facing - then the answers fell
        upon me like rain in July.
      </p>
      <header>
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        Initially I was thinking of tasks that had been simple yet stressed me
        out, but I was struggling to articulate the problem and how I felt
        because I couldn't remember the details, or had decided something else
        was more appropriate. This left me feeling a bit stressed, so when I
        realised I am currently facing a problem that is simple - But I was
        overcomplicating it was natrual to switch and nail down this instead, I
        feel good typing this.
      </p>
      <header>
        <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        Less stress, take a deep breath and chill for a minute - Instead of
        worrying I decided to write something that was easy to think about, and
        work through it bit by bit.

        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        I was unhappy with how my blog was presented, I felt it was lacking in
        charm and was unappealing (needed more <strong>flair</strong>).
      </p>
      <header>
        <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        Thought out what the issues with my blog were, and if it was purely
        aesthetics or if I disliked the content as well. Decided it was a bit of
        both and that some pictures might liven it up.
      </p>
      <header>
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        Decided to add more images from Open at the Met (open source) that fit
        with the theme of each page while I was writing my blog, this helped me
        keep engaged with what I wanted it to look like and add some flavour.

        <h3>What did you learn?</h3>

      <p>
        Adding pictures made it look more appealing, and adding funny alts made
        it crack up for myself.

      <p>
        Throughout this foundations course I have been stuck a lot, and have been unwilling to ask for help since I feel like everyone else is thriving and i don't want to burden others with questions, getting throughthe kata's I realise how silly this is - If i had reached out for help earlier it would not have taken me four days and untold stress. I will take this on board and stop feeling embarassed for needing help.
