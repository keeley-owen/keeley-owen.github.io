          EQ is the playmate of IQ, and can be thought to represent your characters it includes five different spheres; Self-Awareness, Self-Regulation, Motivation, Empathy, & Social Skills. These different competencies represent 'soft skills' and are instrumental in fostering success in personal and work relationships. As these softer skills influence your ability to play nice with others, developing these alongside other more practical skills will help build you into a better human - And will be a big focus on Dev Academy. 
          
          For this exercise we were tasked with practicing mindfulness daily as part of foundations, and the task I have chosen is quiet meditation in the morning with particular focus on my breathing - Which is said to help centre one in the present and be more attentive, I am hopeful this will enhance my ability to grow the above soft skills.

          How is EQ different to IQ?
          </h2>
          <header>
          
          EQ is more focused on being kind and respectful, while adhering to things like boundaries and being respectful and non judgemental. IQ in my opinion, is more focused on your level of comprehension with regards to information, problem solving with maths, and how well you can recall things stored in your information vault.

          EQ skills help in a range of different application, not just those relating to code - By improving our Emotional Intelligence we can be better equipped to handle whatever life throws at us, and can formulate a better understanding of ourselves. Soft skills allow us to connect with our compatriots better, as well as fosters growth within our understanding our self - These skills will be helpful for the rest of our lives, and will ensure someone is able to work well with others.
