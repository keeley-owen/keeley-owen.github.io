      <h1>ID's VS. CLASSES - THE BATTLE</h1>
      <p class="'paragraph-spacing"></p>
      <p>
        What is the difference between ID & Class I hear you say? Me oh my, let
        me enlighten you on the difference between these wonderful tags (and
        educate on on why Class is superior to ID). First off let's start with
        what each is, to a layman like I once was (before I started coding
        approximately six days ago), the nuts and bolt of each is - An ID will
        refer to a single element in your code, such as if you want to make
        adjustments but ONLY want these to affect one part i.e. you do not plan
        to use this again, such as below
      </p>
      <p class="'paragraph-spacing"></p>
      <img id="classes-picture" src="../Classes.png" alt="Classes image" />
      <p>
        Now this is how you would show a unique ID for something, which you will
        only be using one time, and therefore can style however you would like.
        Secondly let's see the absolute beast that is CLASSES which allows you
        assign attributes that you will be using multiple times through your
        code, for example you can see on each of my pages I have the image and
        nabber in the same place for each page - Why? Because this is
        aesthetically pleasing and shows commitment to consistency, and because
        I like how it looks. The example below shows how you would add this into
        your code.
      </p>
      <p class="'paragraph-spacing"></p>
      <img id="id-picture" src="../IDs.png" alt="Classes image" />
      <p>
        Now we have gone over the differences between Classes and ID's you may
        be asking yourself - Don't both of these seem useful for different
        cases? The answer is YES! They are both very useful and will help you
        get your code up to scratch no matter how you want to use them. Thank
        you for viewing my blog!
