      <p><em>
        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing developed by Tā Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective on health, and encompasses four different dimensions; taha tinana (physical wellbeing), taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing), taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing), and taha whānau (family wellbeing) - These four walls have connections to the whenua (land, sea, natrual world) and all form Te Whare Tapa Wha.

        <p>
          The first point of call will be physical wellbeing, which I will improve by commiting to leaving the house for walks during foundations, and walking to campus during bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also focus on getting enough sleep each night, so I am prepared to meet the next morning.
        </p>

        class="center smaller-image"
        />
        <p>
          The second step will be mental and emotional wellbeing, which I will improve by spending less time on my phone in the immediately before and after sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also practice a morning chant to get myself ready for the tasks ahead.
        </p>

        class="center smaller-image"
        />
        <p>
          Third on the list is spiritual wellbeing, whixh I will improve by meditating during the day to refocus and realign my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also try to fill in more journal entries to express myself.
        </p>

        class="center smaller-image"
        />
        <p>
        Fourth is family wellbeing, which I will improve by spending more time with my parents and sisters.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also connect more with my friends where possible.
        </p>

        class="center smaller-image"
        />
        <p>
        Fifth and lucky last is whenua, which will be the easiest to achieve. I will satiate my need for marvelous views by seeking out a scenic once a week, and spending some time enjoying the surrounding landscape (or seascape).
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also look to hug a tree when I'm feeling extra in touch with Papatūānuku, and look towards the stars when I'm in touch with Ranginui.
