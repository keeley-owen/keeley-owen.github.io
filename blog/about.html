      <h1>A bit of info about myself</h1>
      <p class="'paragraph-spacing"></p>
      <header>Values, Strengths, and Limitations.</header>
      <p>
        I've grown up with the value of kindness being a main attribute, which
        to me means helping where help is needed and trying to see things from
        different points of view - For instance, if someone likes coriander it
        would be impolite to berate them for this choice no matter how egregious
        it may seem. Growing up in the idyllic Paekakariki has let me to an
        appreciation of ocean views &lpar;despite a lacklustre swimming
        capability&rpar; which has since broadened to enjoy scenics of all
        shapes and sizes &semi; whether it be a mountain range, a grassy plain,
        or even our great Poneke city scape - The harbour here being a
        particular place I enjoy. I think my culture has played a huge part in
        shaping the man I am today, and while I may not be as in touch with my
        whakakapapa as I would like to be, I understand that doesn't lessen my
        cultural connection and I can still rep my set with pride - Something
        that is literally coursing through my blood. In terms of people who
        shaped me, my friends have helped created a rigorous training regiment
        of witty humour and aligned interests from differing spectrums of media,
        literature, and music. I'm pretty happy with the progress I have made to
        become the person I am now, and am confident I will continue to grow
        into my self with time - Aging like a fine cask of Whiskey.

      <p class="'paragraph-spacing"></p>
      <p>
        My strengths are mainly not technical, however I believe in my
        capability to learn as I've always had a thirst for knowledge, I love
        learning about new things as gaining new skills feels gratifying - I
        think I have good interpersonal skills which will help me in this
        course, as being able to relate to people from all ages and backgrounds
        is something that I am able to do through years of training (having
        customer centric roles throughout my working life) and hard work
        (needing to have a job to survive). I think a willingness to learn will
        assist me the most during this course, as even when it may take me
        awhile to grasp some concepts I will give it my best attempt and not let
        setbacks get me down, as the gratification of completing something
        outweighs the hair-tearing issues that are likely to come up.
      </p>
      <p class="'paragraph-spacing"></p>
      <p>
        My limitations are few and far between, being a being carved out of
        granite with the wisdom of Solomon and the dashing good looks of ,
        however if I were to look at it with a non delusional frame of mind I
        would say that I learn best by doing, and sometimes visual and reading
        aids simply do not stick until I have attempted something (which
        sometimes may take several attempts). I understand my limitations
        involved with joining this course, I have not done any coding in the
        past and have limited exposure to programming languages, taking into
        account that is the main focus of this course I need to be prepared to
        put in extra work where required and remember not to compare myself to
        my compatriots. I think having everything we go over be something 'new'
        may end up being overwhelming at times, so I will need to make sure to
        avoid burn-out and information fatigue .

      <header>Ethics and working a team.</header>
      <p class="paragraph-spacing">
        An ethical decision I have made is choosing to work for companies that
        have values that align with my own, I've worked for big businesses that
        are mainly centred around their profits, with their impact and values
        coming secondary to this main focus. While toiling away as another cog
        in the machine I learned that a lot of diversity and impact reduction
        was mainly done as a way to save face and not with these beliefs as
        intrinsic values to adhere to. I felt like being a part of these and
        perpetuating the cycle was not good for me and what I believe in, so I
        committed to only working for places where their values matched my own,
        I don't want to be a part of a business that doesn't help do their part
        in minimising their impact since this is something I have complete
        control over.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-spacing"></p>
      <p>
        An example on where I have been trying to work productively was was in a
        previous job role of mine, the task was to perform remediation on a part
        of the business that had been under review and as a result there were a
        number of clients due refunds of a substantial amount. This task
        involved coordination with multiple departments with people of varying
        skillsets and positions within the company, this melting pot of people
        unfortunately resulted in a disjointed and wonky implementation - The
        way I managed this was by offering to take on additional tasks and
        trying to explain where the roadblocks were occurring oft fell on deaf
        ears until things went wrong, after which feedback was sought from a
        variety of staff. This taught me that even if you think you have the
        answers, certain things are out of your control so the best practice is
        to not let things outside of your control affect you and to focus on the
        things you can change.
