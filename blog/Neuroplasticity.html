      <p><em>
        Today's lesson will be covering Neuruoplasticity, which is the the brain's ability to change and adapt itself based on different experieneces or learnings. The second topic we will cover is the 'Growth Mindset' which is a way for us to view ourselves as 'malleable', it's the belief that our intellegence, skills, and abilities aren't set in stone and can be improved upon and developed.

        The ability to improvise, adapt, and overcome has long been a trait of Humankind for 65,000 years and is represented in wildly differring ways across the globe - And that is no different than the capabilities of our brain. This ability to change and adapt is something than helps us in a multitude of differnt ways, such as learning, growing, and recovering from injuries. Our brain does this by forming new neural connections and stregthening these pathways. The adaptability of the brain to achieve such things, and our capcity to influence this can be broken down into six things;
      </p>
      <header><h4>
        1. Learning and Practice -
      </h4></header>
      <p>Learning new skills and engaging in activities that stimulate the brain, with regular practice enhances our cognitive functions.</p>

      <header><h4> 
        2. Nutrition & Sleep - 
      </h4></header>
      <p>Maintaining a nutirent rich diet, and adequate sleep are essential to having a heahty brain.</p>

      <header><h4>
        3. Mindfulness and Meditation - 
      </h4></header>
      <p>Practicing mindfulness (covered earlier) promotes changes in our brain structure that helps us with our attention, emotional regulation, and stress management</p>

      <header><h4>
        4. Physical Exercise - 
      </h4></header>
      <p>Regular excercise produces a heathy brain by way of increasing our potential for Neuroplasticity, with growing neurons.</p>

      <header><h4>
        5. Social Interaction -
      </h4></header>
      <p>Engaging in social activities, forming new relationships, and interacting with others stimulates the areas of the brain associated with communication and empathy.</p>

      <header><h4>
        6. Enviromental Enrichment - 
      </h4></header>
      <p>An enviroment that has exposure to different experiences and stimuli can assist with enhancing Neuroplasticity.</p>

      <p>
        There are two different types of Neuroplasticity, Structural and Functional. Structural Plasticity is where the brain physically morphs itself by forming new connections between existing neurons, and growing new neurons. These changes happen across the various regions of the brain all depending on what the learning is. Functional Plasticity refers to the brains ability to reassign functions from damaged areas to non-damaged ones, such as when you've rotted in bed for so long you can no longer walk, your brain will relocate those motor functions to compensate for this.
