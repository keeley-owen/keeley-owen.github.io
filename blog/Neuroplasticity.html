      <p><em>
        Today's lesson will be covering Neuroplasticity, which is the the brain's ability to change and adapt itself based on different experieneces or learnings. The second topic we will cover is the 'Growth Mindset' which is a way for us to view ourselves as 'malleable', it's the belief that our intellegence, skills, and abilities aren't set in stone and can be improved upon and developed.

        The ability to improvise, adapt, and overcome has long been a trait of Humankind for 65,000 years and is represented in wildly differring ways across the globe - And that is no different than the capabilities of our brain. This ability to change and adapt is something than helps us in a multitude of different ways, such as learning, growing, and recovering from injuries. Our brain does this by forming new neural connections and stregthening these pathways. The adaptability of the brain to achieve such things, and our capcity to influence this can be broken down into six things;
      </p>
      <header><h4>
        1. Learning and Practice -
      </h4></header>
      <p>
        Learning new skills and engaging in activities that stimulate the brain, with regular practice enhances our cognitive functions.
      </p>

      <header><h4> 
        2. Nutrition & Sleep - 
      </h4></header>
      <p>
        Maintaining a nutirent rich diet, and adequate sleep are essential to having a heahty brain.
      </p>

      <header><h4>
        3. Mindfulness and Meditation - 
      </h4></header>
      <p>
        Practicing mindfulness (covered earlier) promotes changes in our brain structure that helps us with our attention, emotional regulation, and stress management.
      </p>

      <header><h4>
        4. Physical Exercise - 
      </h4></header>
      <p>
        Regular excercise produces a heathy brain by way of increasing our potential for Neuroplasticity, with growing neurons.
      </p>

      <header><h4>
        5. Social Interaction -
      </h4></header>
      <p>
        Engaging in social activities, forming new relationships, and interacting with others stimulates the areas of the brain associated with communication and empathy.
      </p>

      <header><h4>
        6. Enviromental Enrichment - 
      </h4></header>
      <p>
        An enviroment that has exposure to different experiences and stimuli can assist with enhancing Neuroplasticity.

      <p>
        There are two different types of Neuroplasticity, Structural and Functional. Structural Plasticity is where the brain physically morphs itself by forming new connections between existing neurons, and growing new neurons. These changes happen across the various regions of the brain all depending on what the learning is. Functional Plasticity refers to the brains ability to reassign functions from damaged areas to non-damaged ones, such as when you've rotted in bed for so long you can no longer walk, your brain will relocate those motor functions to compensate for this.

      <p>
        Having a Growth Mindset pertains to the idea that if you believe hard enough, anything is possible with the right training and dedication (fun, wavy, exhilarating). The opposing side to this is a Fixed Mindset, is that somethings simply cannot be changed and we are static (boring, sad, nancy behaviour). These two sides of the coin represent how people think about life and change, although whether it's even just subconsciously this can have an effect on how you charge forward through life and even what you persue. The way this ties into Neuroplasticity is focusing on having a Growth Mindset will natrually boost the pathways in your cranium. Since understanding that we can grow and change into new learnings, and that it is possible to do this at any stage of life, breeds a healthy willingness to be ambitious and tackle the tasks ahead.

        Growth mindsets can be achieved by anyone, and can have a noticeable benefit on ones outlook, such as:
      </p>
      <header><h4>
        1. Optimism and Resilience -
      </h4></header>
      <p>
        Being able to see the positive in things and being resilient to obstacles means you are better equipped to handle whatever is thrown at you, and can lead to overcoming intense situations; Like ordering an enormous sandwich in Subway, with at least seven other people in line before you. Trusting the process of building your Sub and understanding those coming next get to behold the girth of your 12x12 gargantuan-stubstance-block (it will be an awe inspiring experience) allows you to embrace Optimism and Resilience. </p>

      <header><h4>
        2. Increased Effort - 
      </h4></header>
      <p>
        Being able to remain firm in the face of adversity, and putting in the mahi to achieve your goals means you are more likely to succeed in your endevours; Like striving to sleep 14 hours rather than 7, doubling your efficiency by hitting more reps on the pillows grants you twice the brainpower and twice the alertnes, and allows you to spend the remaining day with Increased Effort.
      </p>

      <header><h4>
        3. Improved Learning -
      </h4></header>
      <p>
        Being able to improve your abilities is tied to understanding that intelligence is not fixed, and that with appropriate application you can learn more efficiently; Like learning multiplication from 1-12 times tables, and going to a year 4 clarrom to test your newfound knowledge. The complete evisceration of the students in this allows you to outperform them in the classroom (they think intelligence is fixed) via Improved Learning.

      <p>
        Recognising these factors had led me to change my thought patterns around the learning I've already been doing, since in three short weeks my knowledge of coding has increased from zero (No thoughts in my head, free and liberated of brainjuice) to at least seventeen (I now dream in HTML, I use functions to perform chores, and dress myself via CSS) which is exciting. I'm commiting (pun) my learning from each week and making to sure to take on new ideas and ways of doing things, this should lead me to eventually transcend this corperoeal form and become one with the universe.
