        <em>
          Today I shall recant the illustrious feats of sheer brilliance that
          the DOM is capable of, and the confusing, bewildering, utterly
          mystifying capabilities of Javascript.

        <h2>Javascript and its Relationship to HTML & CSS:</h2>
      </header>
      <img
        src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/819407/1869739/main-image"
        alt="Javascript, HTML, nd CSS after a battle"
        class="center-align-text"
      />
      <p>
        For our first tale, we will learn more about JavaScript and how it
        interacts with HTML & CSS. Now, we can think of JavaScript as the squad
        commander, HTML as our battle-hardened soldiers, and CSS as their
        glorious banner. Each has a part to play, and how they define themselves
        and their part to play is key.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML, our army, forms the foundations of our crusade, structuring the
        very essence of our webpage. CSS, our banner, allows our soldiers to
        display flair and style, making them easily recognizable to friends and
        foes alike. It showcases our unique identity and coat of arms,
        represented by font and styling elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript, our illustrious commander, stands at the helm, orchestrating
        the ebs and flow of combat that is our webpage interactivity. It
        possesses the ability to dynamically respond to various situations and
        user actions, akin to a battlefield general countering enemy advances
        with grace and tact that befits our glorious leader.
      </p>

        <h2>Control Flow & Loops:</h2>
      </header>
      <img
        src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/401327/1597287/main-image"
        alt="Control flow & loops in the midst of controlling & looping"
        class="center-align-text"
      />
      <p>
        Now, we move on to Control Flow, which is like infiltrating enemy
        territory. You'll need to chart a course and adapt to changing
        conditions as more intel becomes available. JavaScript accomplishes this
        by following a predetermined path but can make decisions based on
        conditions that you control. An example of this is having a baseline
        mission structure and an outline of routine paths and advances.
        Differing conditions will mean the approach changes, like when you're in
        a swamp or a desert; your routine must adapt accordingly, this is
        Control Flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loops are next, and they are far easier to explain. Loops are steeped in
        the repetition of a task and can be thought of as practicing battle
        maneuvers. You practice these through repetition until a desired outcome
        is reached. You may need to practice loops a small or large number of
        times until you reach your objective. It is a fundamental part of
        JavaScript and allows us to easily get data, or tasks as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of these from everyday life (which was the original question
        parameter I glossed over in my excitement to make everything battle
        related) would be a Monday routine performed in order every Monday; The
        usual flow of your monday is, wake up, reminisce about being asleep mere
        moments ago, make a coffee, quietly experience dread, have a shower,
        pontificate, get dressed, spin around in a circle four times, and then
        crack on with your day. Now lets say you wake up absolutely manic, and
        you have the energy of one thousand suns, with this condition you may
        choose to replace your moments of respite between tasks with shouting
        "WOO!", this is possible with Control Flow. Or the opposite of this, you
        may wake up with the enthusiasim of a tortoise, and choose to skip all
        of these tasks instead, this is also Control Flow.
      </p>

        <h2>The DOM (Document Object Model):</h2>
      </header>
      <img
        src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/773263/1808948/main-image"
        alt="The DOM ripping apart its objectors"
        class="center-align-text"
      />
      <p>
        The DOM is our next topic, and although it was exceptionally confusing
        at first, once you understand how to let it asist you, it becomes akin
        to a trusted vizier that will not betray you.
      </p>
      <p>
        THe DOM allows you to reshape your code in browser, without affecting
        the source, and lets you freely test out and view where issues may be
        arising from, while providing important context for your webpage - It
        melds with Javascript in showing you the interactivity of your page,
        while bringing up where the issues are at the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        An example of where the DOM has come in handy for me, was I could not
        for the life of me understand why my webpage was not displaying
        correctly, as I had followed the instructions to a T and was certain
        there were no mistakes, feverishly looking over my code for anything out
        of the ordinary. As it turns out I could have just looked at the error
        showing in the console, and determine from there that I had not made a
        letter uppercase, instead of pouring over the whole sheet looking in
        every nook and cranny. This made me appreciate the DOM more than I
        could've imagined.

        <h2>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects:</h2>
      </header>
      <img
        src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/819408/1869740/main-image"
        alt="Arrays & Objects accessing data amidst chaos on the battlefield"
        class="center-align-text"
      />
      <p>
        Now, We shall cut the battle themes for the rest of the blog in order to
        express the content in a more succient fashion as we move onto Arrays &
        Objects, fitting these with acts of millitary might proved rather
        difficult...
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays are fantastic little buckets we can use to store information and
        they are all numbered neatly in a row, starting from 0. We can use an
        Javascript to get the contents of these vessels, which are numbered from
        left to right and all seperate. We may want to store this information
        logically, like arrange things based on alphabetical order or most
        important to least important, the array will not discriminate and simply
        numbers the vessel off accordingly based on placement. You may have a
        list of meats ['Beef', 'Chicken', 'Kereru', 'Duck', 'Pork', 'Bambi'] and
        you may want Duck, you would command Javascript to pull out meatbox 4
        for Duck in this instance, however to get to the succulent Kereru you'll
        need to (politely) ask for meatbox 3 instead. Wow you've learnt so much
        from this!
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are up next, and they can be thought of as drawers, and they
        contain different information in each drawer that has its own little
        label (key). Next, to access one of these draws, you can ask Javascript
        to grab the information contained out ONLY after you have given it the
        label of said draw, for example if you have a Object called Ken the
        Kereru with the following information; {name: Ken, meat: Kereru, age:
        38, taste: Delicious, sex: rarely} and you want it's name, you'd ask
        Javascript for the 'name' draw, if you want it's age you'd ask for the
        'age' draw instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, Arrays work off numbers from 0 upwards, and Objects work off
        labels (keys) to get the values. If you need a list of names an Array
        makes sense, if you need information that's organised via labels go with
        an Object instead.
      </p>

        <h2>Functions and Their Importance:</h2>
      </header>
      <img
        src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/341583/1808959/main-image"
        alt="Functions performing a deus ex machina after a crushing ambush"
        class="center-align-text"
      />
      <p>
        Finally, we have Functions! Which are super fun once you get the hang of
        them, and not at all confusing at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nuts and bolts of Functions are they are reusable instructions in
        your code that can be called upon in your time of need, whenever that
        may be. Functions are given names, and they contain instructions for
        tasks that are called arguments, and we then call upon it by using its
        name.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are very handy as it allows us to keep our code neat(ish) and make
        it easier to manage, since we can call upon the function multiple times
        at different points as well.
