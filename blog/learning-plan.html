      <p>
        I've given this some more thought since the foundations blurb, I still
        don't exactly know where I see myself long term (or even in the next
        year) but I want to be somewhere that has a good work/life balance. I
        want to earn enough to be able to do the things I want, and I want to be
        surrounded by good vibes and atmosphere.

      </h2>
      <p>
        Biggest strengths will be a can-do attitude and good energy. Biggest
        limitations will be limited tech skills and nerves about bootcamp in
        general, I'm excited and aprehensive in the same capacity.

        Learning, I find it hard to continue on if I don't feel like I grasp
        things, and will the understanding that it will be a fast paced

        reflecting and let information digest.

      <p>
        I would like to work more on my communication skills, I can effectively
        communicate sometimes but I have trouble articulating things in a easy
        to understand format - Being able to get my points across without
        overexplaining would be ideal.

        not go amiss.

        I want to give this as good of a go as I can, so I can look back and
        know I did my best. I will commit to working as effectively & safely as
        I can and am always happy to take feedback or suggestions onboard. I
        will keep to tasks I set out and make sure to reflect on situations
        where I can improve.

        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

      <p>
        I'm unsure at this point, I know what I don't want to do but with the
        possibilities of something I *do* want to do being so broad, I'm not
        certain on what pathway will be the right fit - I do know that I want to
        work somewhere that values me and is genuine about this, I also want to
        do something that makes me feel proud. I definitely know what type of
        'feeling' I want for my career even if I don't know where that will be.

      </h2>
      <p>
        My strengths lay in drive and application, once I've got the general
        gist of something I find it easy to branch out and try new things, and
        do not fear exploring topics or tasks deeper. A limitation would be
        sometimes I don't realise I have a block, and will try to complete a
        task instead of trying something else for a while (often to my own
        detriment) which is something I'm actively trying to work on. I also
        find it difficult to ask for help from other people, but I have no
        problem doing independent research to see if I can find the answers
        myself.

      <p>
        I would like to see development of my communication and team work
        skills, I think this course will help greatly in this regard due to the
        structure of working as a team in the cohorts as well as group/paired
        assignments.

          help in a timely way
        </h2>
      </header>

      <p>
        I will commit myself to working productively by not overloading myself
        too often, I have a tendency to take on too many things at once and end
        up stuck, often feeling like it's too overwhelming to do anything - I
        have been working on this by focusing on a small amount of things
        throughout the day, breaking it down in bits rather than stressing over
        the scope of everything. In terms of working with others, I will
        actively try to contribute where possible and make sure other's
        suggestions and feedback is taken on board, by making sure I'm actively
        being a team player and contributing it will help those I'm working with
        feel like their effort is being validated. I will being good chat and
        vibes where possible.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-spacing"></p>
      <p>
        Seeking help in a timely way will be something I need to work on, I
        research things a lot and make sure I understand them conceptually
        before getting stuck in, so being more comfortable to ask my facilitator
        and cohort questions will be something that will come as I get more
        comfortable with the course.

      <p>
        Support when things get hard, sometimes it will not necessarily be I'm
        stuck on technical tasks, but might need somebody to talk the problem
        through and bounce ideas off so I can come to the solution. So far
        knowing there is someone to go to if things take a turn makes a big
        difference as I know if I need help, I can reach out, which removes the
        anxiety of things that seem super complex.

        I've got therapy commitments to adhere to and thankfully will be able to
        work the times of these sessions within the break times during bootcamp,
        during Foundations it's far easier to make the time available.
