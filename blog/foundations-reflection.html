        This blog post will be reflecting on my time in foundations, and how I have grown over the last month coding and learning.

          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
        </h3></header>

        <p>
          <ul>I can do this even if sometimes I think I can't, making it to the end of foundations is a big win for my ego - There's been a few times I wanted to give up (a lot actually) but after chilling out and reassessing the situation, I've been able to keep vibing.</ul>
          <ul>I am a pro-procrastinator, and when left to my own devices I will twiddle my thumbs aimlessly and then regret this decision, which is not condusive to being productive or feeling good about my productivity.</ul>
          <ul>I can handle setbacks better than I thought, and reframing the problems as something to learn about has helped keep enthusiasium about the work.</ul>

          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        </h3></header>

        <p>
          I think they play a large part, it would be 50% coding and 50% core values - They're skills that help build someone into a condusive member of a team. I feel they'll be valued as essential given the fact that they help with the personal touch, which is just as important as the tech side.

          What has surprised you the most about the core learning?

        <p>
          The emphisis on core learning has made me rethink about my priorities when it comes to what I want to bring to the table with employment, it helps give context on what makes someone effective and how you can look to improve personal development. It's something I hadn't given much thought to previously.

          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?

        />
        <p>
          Actualy putting the learning into practice and remembering to take action, I will often forget to have adequate rest or practice mindfulness, so keeping on with these until they are habbitual will be the move.

          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3></header>

        <img

        class="center smaller-image"
        />
        <p>
          Given the fact that the technical skills is a given when looking to move/progress in a particular industry, having the focus on building the core/soft skills is something I feel a lot of places/people will look past - Yet it is such a vital part of any professional/personal endevour. Focusing on these aspects will only help enhance our growth. 
        </p>

          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3></header>

        <p>
          I really appreciate the focus on core parts, it helps me reset - I like it the most when it's after the tech part, as it lets you refresh and stretch other mental muscles. Feels like a nice reward for learning all the code.
